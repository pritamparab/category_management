# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Premium Access Management

## RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

RBAC is a security mechanism where users are assigned roles, and each role defines specific permissions. This simplifies managing access in large systems.

### Key Concepts:
- **Roles:** Defined sets of permissions, e.g., "admin," "user1."
- **Users:** Individuals assigned one or more roles.
- **Permissions:** Actions that can be performed (e.g., read, write).
- **Role Assignments:** Users are assigned roles based on their job function.

RBAC follows the principle of least privilege, ensuring users only have access to what they need.

## Flow of Premium Access Management

Premium access is dynamically managed based on user subscription levels, where permissions change depending on their plan.

### Steps:
1. **Subscription Status:** Users are assigned a "Premium User" role when they are subscribed to the premium plan by admin.
2. **Dynamic Role Assignment:** The system updates roles in real-time based on subscription changes.
3. **Real-Time Permission Updates:** The application checks and updates permissions when the user logs in or accesses features.
4. **Expiration/Renewal:** Expired subscriptions revoke premium roles; renewed subscriptions restore them.
5. **Audit and Logging:** Role and permission changes are logged for transparency.

### Example Flow:
- **Subscribing to Premium:** User's role is updated to "Premium User."
- **Accessing Premium Features:** The user accesses features, granted based on their role.
- **Expiration:** Premium access is revoked if the subscription expires.
